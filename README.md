# Mini AI Chatbot
This is a simple chatbot built with JavaScript! It can:
  1/ Respond to greetings and questions.
  2/ Solve basic math problems.
  3/ Handle custom user contexts like remembering your name.
  4/ Share fun facts, recipes, and more!
The bot uses a responses.json file for predefined answers and features a dark/light mode toggle for a better user experience. A fun project to explore JavaScript and conversational AI!
